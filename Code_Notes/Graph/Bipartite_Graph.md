# Bipartite Graph
A graph is said to be bipartite if only by using 2 colors we can color the whole graph and two adjacent nodes should not have same color.

1. linear graph is always bipartite
2. A graph with cycle with even no. of nodes is bipartite 
3. cycle with odd no. of nodes is not bipartite.
